Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

    In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  
    
    <article>
    <aside>
    <details>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <header>
    <main>
    <mark>
    <nav>
    <section>
    <summary>
    <time>



        <p>the sematic tags this all the tags are the empty tags but this tag don't perform any type of operationin it
            this tags are used to define which section of the program is perform in this tag 

            eg:- header tag contains the program input for header so all this tag contain the different progrmaing.
